				Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is considered one of the most influential artists in Western art history. He was born on March 30, 1853, in Zundert, Netherlands, and died on July 29, 1890, in Auvers-sur-Oise, France. Van Gogh's artistic career spanned only a decade, but he created a vast body of work, including approximately 2,100 artworks, consisting of paintings, drawings, and sketches. <br>

<p2 style="font-size: larger;">
	During his lifetime, Van Gogh struggled with mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. Despite his personal challenges, he produced artworks that are now regarded as masterpieces. However, his talent went unrecognized during his lifetime, and he only sold one painting. <br>
</p2> <br> <br>
<p3 style="font-size: larger;">
	Van Gogh's artistic style evolved over the years. In his early works, he painted in a dark, realistic style influenced by Dutch masters such as Rembrandt. Later, he moved to Paris and was exposed to Impressionism and Japanese woodblock prints, which greatly influenced his style. Van Gogh developed his unique post-impressionist style characterized by bold brushstrokes, vibrant colors, and emotional expression. <br>
</p3><br> <br>
<p4 style="font-size: larger;">
	Some of Van Gogh's most famous paintings include "Starry Night," "Sunflowers," "The Bedroom," and "Café Terrace at Night." His paintings often depicted landscapes, still lifes, and portraits, infused with his personal emotions and experiences. Van Gogh's use of intense, expressive colors and dynamic brushwork contributed to his distinctive style and emotional impact. <br>

</p4> <br> <br>
<p5 style="font-size: larger;">
	Despite his relatively short career, Van Gogh's artistic contributions have had a profound and lasting influence on modern art. His bold experimentation with color and brushwork paved the way for later movements such as Fauvism and Expressionism. Today, Van Gogh is widely celebrated as one of the greatest painters in history, and his works continue to inspire and captivate audiences worldwide. <br>
